# What is this?

First attempt at creating a published node module.

# Why?

I like eslint and I so far I like prettier. So I created this node module designed to be an eslint config extension.

# How to use?

Just add `jloleysens` to the extends key in your `.eslintrc` and make sure to install the peer dependencies.
